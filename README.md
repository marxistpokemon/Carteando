# About Carteando

Game making tools should be as accessible as possible, and this is not limited to digital game makers. Even if you need only pen and paper to start a brand new card game, it can quickly escalate in complexity. If you decide to use a computer to help out with the design and make it look good too, then you need even more repertoire and previous knowledge.

The goal of *Carteando* is to help game making people to **quickly and easily create functional and nice looking cards for print-and-play prototypes and games**. Write the text on your cards and game rules, upload some images and then just press the print button on your browser. The easier, the better: no installations, no need for internet too (we'll try to keep it as portable as possible).
