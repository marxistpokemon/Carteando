That's it, in a nutshell.\r\n\r\nGame making tools should be as accessible as possible, and this is not limited to digital game makers. Even if you need only pen and paper to start a brand new card game, it can quickly escalate in complexity. If you decide to use a computer to help out with the design and make it look good too, then you need even more repertoire and previous knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe goal of *Carteando* is to help game making people to **quickly and easily create functional and nice looking cards for print-and-play prototypes and games**. Write the text on your cards and game rules, upload some images and then just press the print button on your browser. The easier, the better: no installations, no need for internet too (we'll try to keep it as portable as possible).\r\n\r\n#### General design principles\r\n\r\n- Less is more;\r\n- Easy to localize;\r\n- Appealing and inviting: it should be (at least a bit) fun to use;\r\n- It should be as accessible as possible: cross-browser, responsive, graceful;\r\n\r\n#### Technical basis\r\n\r\n- A browser-based application that uses client-side JS and CSS: access an online URL or a local version and BAM! there you have it;\r\n- All text editing needed will be made using [zenpen](https://github.com/tholman/zenpen) (or the embedable jQuery version of it) and stored as either Markdown or plain text;\r\n- Drawing the cards will be done via [D3JS](https://github.com/mbostock/d3);\r\n- Printing styles will be made via CSS;\r\n\r\n#### The fuzzy future (aka. wishlist)\r\n\r\n- Image upload;\r\n- Grid-based design for the cards (probably using [gridster.js](http://gridster.net/));\r\n- CSS-based custom styling (using [selectize.js](https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js) for adding/managing custom classes);\r\n- Local storage saving;\r\n- Exporters for CSV, XML, and other formats so the cards' data can be further developed in more powerful tools and more easily localized/revised;\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
